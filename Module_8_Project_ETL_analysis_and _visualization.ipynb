    "Description: This query retrieves the total sales data for Men's and Women's clothing stores from the 'mrts' table.\n",
    "Query: The provided SQL query selects the month, business, and total sales columns from the 'mrts' table, filtering the data for the specified businesses using the WHERE clause. The result is grouped by month and business.\n",
    "Demonstration: In the Python script, the SQL query is constructed using f-strings, which allow the values of the businesses_to_compare list to be dynamically included in the query. The execute_sql function is called with the query, which executes the SQL query and returns the result as a DataFrame. The resulting DataFrame is then processed to format the month column as a datetime and pivot the data to have businesses as columns and months as rows.\n",
    "Compute Percentage Change Over Time:\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: This step computes the percentage change in sales over time for Men's and Women's clothing stores.\n",
    "Demonstration: The pivot result DataFrame obtained from the previous step is used to calculate the percentage change over time using the pct_change() method in pandas. This method calculates the percentage change between consecutive months. The resulting DataFrame, percentage_change, contains the percentage change values for each business and month.\n",
    "Compute Total Sales:\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: This query calculates the total sales for all businesses for each month.\n",
    "Query: The SQL query selects the month and total sales columns from the 'mrts' table and calculates the sum of sales for each month using the SUM() function. The result is grouped by month.\n",
    "Demonstration: The SQL query is executed using the execute_sql function, and the result is returned as a DataFrame. Similar to the previous step, the month column is formatted as a datetime and set as the index for the DataFrame.\n",
    "Compute Percentage Contribution to Total Sales:\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: This step calculates the percentage contribution of each business to the total sales for each month.\n",
    "Demonstration: The pivot result DataFrame is divided by the total sales DataFrame, column-wise, using the div() method in pandas. This calculates the percentage contribution of each business to the total sales for each month. The resulting DataFrame, percentage_contribution, contains the percentage contribution values for each business and month.\n",
    "By executing the above queries in a Python environment and examining the resulting DataFrames and computations, it can be demonstrated that the queries against the MRTS dataset are functioning correctly. The sales data, percentage changes, and contributions are accurately calculated, providing valuable insights into the performance of Men's and Women's clothing stores in terms of total sales and relative growth over time."
